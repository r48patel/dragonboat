	<h3>What is Dragon Boat?</h3>
	<p>
		Dragon Boat is a global sport with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat#History">2500 year history</a>. A steersman pilots a boat powered by 20 paddlers who are kept in sync by a drummer at the bow. Synchronization is the most critical skill to develop for a new team, followed by proper technique and then finally strength.
	</p>
	<h3>How long is the race?</h3>
	<p>
		A race is 500 meters long, and is usually completed in fewer than 3 minutes.
	</p>
	<h3>When is the race?</h3>
	<p>
		The Bazaarvoice dragon boat team will be racing on April 29th (9am – 3pm)
	</p>
	<h3>Practices</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>We’ll get 4 one-hour practice slots to get everyone up to speed on the sport and train.</li>
			<li>They will held on weekends from April 1st to April 23rd. Time and Date TBD</li>
			<li>Location: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Rowing+Club/@30.2605672,-97.7417732,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xee5307e1cabe580?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUwLvvyqrSAhVr74MKHcZxAcMQ_BIIfjAK">  Austin Rowing Club’s Waller Creek Boathouse </a></li>
			<li>In an hour long practice, we may ask you to <strong>paddle for 5ish minutes at a time</strong>, but a majority of practice will be drills less than 2 minutes long.
				Effective paddlers will get a <strong>good core workout</strong>, but large <strong>back and shoulder muscles</strong> are also used.</li>
